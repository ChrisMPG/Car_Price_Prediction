# Welcome, my name is Christian! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About me
My name is Christian GonÃ§alves, soon to be grad with a Bachelor's in Information Management Systems. 

New Jersey Native, with a passion for data science, I'm learning some data visualization tools such as Tableau to enrich my portfolio. As of today, I've developed some skills by learning R and SQL in my academic course and Python in my free time.  

As for my future, I hope one day to work in a major company, learning every day and getting better and better at my role, bringing value to the company, and delivering the best performance possible.
